### Inventories

The `inventories` directory contains Ansible inventory files that define the hosts and groups that Ansible will manage. Inventory files are YAML or INI formatted files that describe the hosts and their connection information.

### Learning

The `learning` directory contains examples, tutorials, and other educational resources for learning Ansible. That I have been following, or to try something new out

### Playbooks

The `playbooks` directory contains Ansible playbooks, which are YAML files that define the tasks and configurations that Ansible will apply to the managed hosts. Playbooks can perform a wide range of actions, such as installing packages, configuring files, and managing services.

### Roles

The `roles` directory contains Ansible roles, which are collections of tasks and configurations that can be reused across multiple playbooks. Roles can be used to abstract away complex or repetitive configurations, making playbooks more readable and maintainable.
